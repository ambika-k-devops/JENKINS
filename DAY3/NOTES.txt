SCM Polling
============

1)Jenkins polls SCM based on a defined schedule

2)If new commits are found, the build is triggered.

Pros: Always builds the latest code changes
Cons: Frequent polling can use a lot of server resources.


Periodic Builds
===============

1)Jenkins builds at specified intervals, regardless of code changes,
 
2)You set a cron-like schedule for builds,Builds occur based on this schedule

Pros: Regular builds, independent of code changes.
Cons: May build the same code if no new commits exist



GitHub Webhook
==============

GitHub notifies Jenkins of code changes immediately.

Pros: Immediate build triggering, reducing lag.

Cons: Requires proper webhook configuration.

webhook congiguration

Code Coverage
=============
Tool: JaCoCo

Goal: Ensure code coverage is at least 80%.


1)Identify untested code using JaCoCo reports.

2)Write more tests for uncovered areas.

NOTE:Set Jenkins to fail builds if coverage is below 80%
